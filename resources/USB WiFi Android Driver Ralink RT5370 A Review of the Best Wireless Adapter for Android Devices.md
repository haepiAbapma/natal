 `tar xvjf DPO_RT5572_LinuxSTA_2.6.1.3_20121022.tar.bz2`

 `mv DPO_RT5572_LinuxSTA_2.6.1.3_20121022 rt5370` 
## Step 3: Compile and install the driver
 
The final step is to compile and install the driver on your device. You will need to have a compiler toolchain installed on your device to do this. You can use an app like NDK C++ Toolchain or GCC Plugin for C4droid to install a compiler on your device.
 
If you are using NDK C++ Toolchain, open the app and tap on Install NDK button. This will download and install the necessary tools for compiling C and C++ code on your device.
 
If you are using GCC Plugin for C4droid, open C4droid app and tap on Preferences button. Then tap on GCC plugin settings and tap on Install GCC button. This will download and install the GCC compiler on your device.
 
Once you have installed a compiler toolchain, open a terminal emulator app and navigate to the rt5370 folder using the cd command:
 `cd rt5370` 
Then run the following command to compile the driver:
 `make` 
This will create a file called rt5370sta.ko in the os/linux folder.
 
To install the driver, you will need to copy this file to the /system/lib/modules folder on your device using the cp command:
 `cp os/linux/rt5370sta.ko /system/lib/modules` 
You will also need to change the permissions of this file using the chmod command:
 `chmod 644 /system 8cf37b1e13
